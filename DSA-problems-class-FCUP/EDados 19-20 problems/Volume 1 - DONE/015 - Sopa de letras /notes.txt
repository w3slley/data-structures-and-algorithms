Try to implement something like the algorithm you used to solve the game of life problem: go through each position and check if you can form the wanted word in the horizontal or in the vertical direction.

Right now the algorithm is capable of solving correctly the inputs given. However it is very slow for high cols and line numbers.I have to figure out a way to improve its efficiency.
The algorithm I made to reverse the string that was making everything slow. To reverse it, I used new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString(). 

Objetivo agora é obter o mesmo resultado só que sem utilizar concatenação de chars!
